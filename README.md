# tabula-modified

`tabula-modified` is a modification of another package called tabula-py, with the difference that it extracts more characters (like â‰¥) reliably.
The original tabula-py is a simple Python wrapper of [tabula-java](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java), which can read tables from a PDF and convert them into pandas DataFrames.
`tabula-modified` also enables you to convert a PDF file into a CSV, a TSV or a JSON file.
